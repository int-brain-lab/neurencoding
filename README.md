# Neurencoding

Neurencoding is a python package for implementing encoding models of single-unit activity for (at the moment) units recorded using electrophysiology. This package provides tools for expressing single-unit firing as a function of many external variables, such as task-related events and values.

This is the package used for the International Brain Lab (IBL) brain-wide map paper.
